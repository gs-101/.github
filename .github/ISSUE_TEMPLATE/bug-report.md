# Preamble

Please keep your title short, as I recommend/make issue pull requests based on their number and name. A long title makes them too long.

If your report envolves code, please wrap it in a details block:

<details>

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
}
```
</details>

This reduces the clutter in your messages.

# Pictures?

If your issue needs some visual representation to be better understood, add a screenshot or video in a drop down:

</details>

See that empty line? It's important, as not using it can break the content inside the block.
